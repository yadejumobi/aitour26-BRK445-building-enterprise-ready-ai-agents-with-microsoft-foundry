# How to run the demo locally

This file provides step-by-step instructions to build and run the `aspiredemo` (`src/BRK445-Zava-Aspire.slnx`) solution locally. 

## Agent Framework Selection and Working modes

The Store frontend allows switching between different working modes. The available modes and their behavior are defined in code in `src/ZavaWorkingModes/WorkingMode.cs` (see `WorkingMode` and `WorkingModeProvider`). Use the **Settings** page in the Store frontend to switch modes. Selections are saved to browser `localStorage` and are applied immediately.

Available working modes (as defined by the code):

- DirectCall (short name: `directcall`) — "Direct HTTP Call": the UI performs direct HTTP calls to the backend business services without AI orchestration.
- Llm (short name: `llm`) — "LLM Direct Call": direct interaction with large language models using the configured LLM client for agent-like behaviors.
- MafFoundry (short name: `maf_foundry`) — "MAF - Microsoft Foundry Agents": uses Microsoft Agent Framework agents deployed and hosted in Microsoft Foundry (this is the default working mode).
- MafAIFoundry (short name: `maf_ai_foundry`) — "MAF - Microsoft AI Foundry Agents": variant that targets Microsoft AI Foundry-hosted agents (also supported by the parser)
- MafLocal (short name: `maf_local`) — "MAF - Local Agents": creates local agents using the configured local model (e.g. gpt-5-mini) and configured tools.

Notes from the implementation in `src/ZavaWorkingModes`:

- The default mode is `MafFoundry`.
- The provider exposes display names, short names (used in URLs/localStorage) and human-friendly descriptions.
- The parser supports short names such as `directcall`, `llm`, `maf_foundry`, `maf_ai_foundry`, `maf_local` and falls back to the default when an unknown value is provided.

For the authoritative list of working modes, short names, display names and descriptions see the code: `src/ZavaWorkingModes/WorkingMode.cs`.

### Selecting the working mode

1. Open the **Store** application in your browser.
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the left-hand navigation.
3. Pick one of the working modes above.
4. Your selection is saved automatically in `localStorage` and takes effect immediately — no restart required.

## Quick start (terminal)

Open PowerShell / Bash in the solution folder `./src` and run the Aspire CLI to start the local dev-time orchestration. This repository uses the Aspire AppHost pattern and the solution file is `src/BRK445-Zava-Aspire.slnx`.

From the `src` folder run:

```bash
# Start dev-time orchestration with Aspire (preferred)
aspire run
```

The `aspire run` command will automatically find the AppHost, build the solution, and launch the dev-time orchestration. When ready it will print a dashboard URL with a login token — open that URL to access the Aspire dashboard and the demo UI. See https://aspire.dev/get-started/first-app/#run-the-app for details.

## Running in CodeSpaces

Check the video here for a walkthrough: **< coming soon >**

## Running in Visual Studio

1. Open `src/BRK445-Zava-Aspire.slnx` in Visual Studio.
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project `ZavaAppHost` (the Aspire AppHost project) and select `Set as Startup Project`.
3. Press F5 to run (or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging). Note that `aspire run` is the preferred developer flow for local orchestration; Visual Studio run/debug provides an alternative debugging experience.

## Running in Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio Code Insiders

1. Open the `src` folder in Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio Code Insiders.
2. Use `aspire run` from a terminal inside the workspace for the recommended developer experience; it will show the Aspire dashboard URL in the terminal when ready.
3. Alternatively, you can run or debug the `ZavaAppHost` project from the C# extension launch configurations if you prefer an IDE-attached debug session.

The Aspire dashboard URL printed in the console (for example `https://localhost:17104/login?t=...`) will open the demo UI in your browser.


## 1st run: set secrets

The first time running the solution, the Aspire dashboard will prompt you to set up the necessary secrets for accessing Azure resources. Complete the values in the form:

- `aifoundry` is the connection string: `Endpoint=https://<your-resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/;ApiKey=<your-api-key>`
- `applicationinsights` is the Application Insights connection string from your Application Insights resource
- `aifoundryproject` is the Project endpoint URL from your AI Foundry project settings page
- `customerinformationagentid`, `inventoryagentid` and all the other agent ids are the agent IDs you created in the previous step; see `02.NeededCloudResources.md` for details.

Check the `Save to user secrets` box to save them in your user secrets project for future runs.

## Troubleshooting

### Azure CLI Not Found

**Error**: `bash: az: command not found`

**Solution**: Install Azure CLI in your environment:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu (including dev containers)
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

# Verify installation
az --version
```

After installation, authenticate with Azure:

```bash
az login --tenant <your-tenant-url> --use-device-code
```

Replace `<your-tenant-url>` with your Azure tenant domain (e.g., `yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com`).

### Build Errors - File Permission Issues

**Error**: `error MSB3374: The last access/last write time on file "obj/Debug/net10.0/*.cache" cannot be set. Access to the path '...' is denied.`

This error commonly occurs in dev containers or when switching between different development environments.

**Solution**: Clean and rebuild the solution:

```bash
cd /workspaces/aitour26-BRK445-building-enterprise-ready-ai-agents-with-azure-ai-foundry/src

# Clean the solution
dotnet clean

# Remove obj and bin folders with elevated permissions
sudo find . -type d -name "obj" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
sudo find . -type d -name "bin" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true

# Rebuild the solution
dotnet build
```

### Missing Aspire Workload

**Error**: `The name 'DistributedApplication' does not exist in the current context` or similar errors in the `ZavaAppHost` project.

**Solution**: Install the .NET Aspire workload:

```bash
# Install Aspire workload
dotnet workload install aspire

# Verify installation
dotnet workload list

# Rebuild the solution
cd /workspaces/aitour26-BRK445-building-enterprise-ready-ai-agents-with-azure-ai-foundry/src
dotnet build
```

### Agent Deployment Issues

**Error**: Authentication failures when running the console application in `/infra` folder.

**Solution**: Ensure you're logged in to Azure CLI before running the agent deployment console application. The infra deployment is a separate .NET console app in the `infra` folder and is executed with `dotnet run` from that folder (this is independent from the Aspire demo AppHost run).

```bash
# Login to Azure with device code authentication
az login --tenant <your-tenant-url> --use-device-code

# Verify you're logged in
az account show

# Then run the agent deployment (from the infra folder)
cd /workspaces/aitour26-BRK445-building-enterprise-ready-ai-agents-with-azure-ai-foundry/infra
dotnet run
```

### Build Warnings

The solution may show numerous nullable reference warnings (CS8604, CS8618, etc.). These are non-critical warnings related to nullable reference types and do not prevent the application from running. They can be safely ignored for development purposes.

### Dev Container Specific Issues

If you're running in a dev container and experience persistent permission issues:

1. **Rebuild the dev container**: Use the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

2. **Check workspace permissions**: Ensure your workspace folder has appropriate permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) /workspaces/aitour26-BRK445-building-enterprise-ready-ai-agents-with-azure-ai-foundry
   ```

3. **Clear all build artifacts**: Before rebuilding, ensure all artifacts are removed:

   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/aitour26-BRK445-building-enterprise-ready-ai-agents-with-azure-ai-foundry/src
   git clean -xdf
   dotnet build
   ```

### Additional Help

If you continue experiencing issues:

1. Check that all prerequisites from `Prerequisites.md` are installed
2. Verify your Azure resources are properly configured as described in `02.NeededCloudResources.md`
3. Ensure all user secrets are correctly set as shown in the "1st run: set secrets" section above
4. Review the Application Insights logs for runtime errors

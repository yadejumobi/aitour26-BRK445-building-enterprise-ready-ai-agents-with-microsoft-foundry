1. Scope: Demo of a .NET Aspire-based solution — shows Aspire orchestration and the single entry point connecting components. [00:00:05 – 00:00:25]
2. Agents & services: Single-agent demo (also multi-agent exists) with business service endpoints connected to Microsoft Foundry; supports different working modes and LLM usage. [00:00:27 – 00:00:41]
3. Store & semantic search: Front-end (Sava Labs) lists products (paint, drill, circular saw) and demonstrates semantic search using embeddings and vector search ("paint my room"). [00:01:25 – 00:01:52]
4. Photo analysis flow: Upload/choose an image; agent triggers cloud-based photo analysis and generates a description (e.g., "small living room with wooden flooring, white walls"). [00:02:10 – 00:03:03]
5. Agent reasoning & inventory matching: The single agent runs a stepwise flow (analyze → fetch customer info → reason → match tools with inventory → recommend actions). [00:03:15 – 00:04:13]
6. Observability & tracing: Aspire traces show timings (e.g., photo analysis ~12s, thread build ~4s); traces available via Application Insights and cloud deployment for real-time monitoring. [00:04:24 – 00:05:06]

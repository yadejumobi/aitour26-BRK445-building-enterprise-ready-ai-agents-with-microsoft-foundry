## 🚀Get Started

The workshop mixes short live demos with recorded segments for reference.

### 🏋️Preparation (presenter quick-check)

Purpose: a short, actionable checklist to get a presenter ready for a live session. The repo contains more detailed setup steps in `./docs/01.Installation.md` — use the checklist below as the final pre-session verification.

Pre-session checklist (30–60 minutes before)

- [ ] Clone the repository (or pull latest if already cloned)
- [ ] Install prerequisites — follow `session-delivery-resources/docs/Prerequisites.md`
- [ ] Deploy required cloud resources (see `session-delivery-resources/docs/02.NeededCloudResources.md`) or confirm they already exist
- [ ] Follow the instructions in `session-delivery-resources/docs/03.HowToRunDemoLocally.md` to run the demo locally and verify health endpoints

Fallback & recording guidance

- If a live demo fails (service doesn't start, index not ready, or external resource is inaccessible) — play the recorded demo clip for that segment and mark the runbook with the issue.
- For fragile demos (search/indexing, external APIs), prefer the recorded fallback during high-risk sessions.

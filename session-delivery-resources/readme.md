## 🚀Get Started

The workshop mixes short live demos with recorded segments for reference.

### 🕐Timing

| 07 mins | Introduction & content | Live | Presenter: lead — slides 1–3 |
| 06 mins | Demo — AI Foundry Agents | Live (recorded fallback) | [Recorded demo](https://aka.ms/AAxri1g) |
| 04 mins | Content | Live | Key point: agent overview |
| 06 mins | Demo — Aspire + Single Agent | Recorded (recommended) | [Recorded demo VS2022](https://aka.ms/AAxrpqj) <br> [Recorded demo CodeSpaces](https://aka.ms/AAyescm) |
| 03 mins | Content | Live | Transition & Q&A |
| 07 mins | Demo — Multi-Agent Orchestration | Live (recorded fallback) | [Recorded demo](https://aka.ms/AAxrab6)  <br> [Recorded demo CodeSpaces](https://aka.ms/AAyescl) |
| 04 mins | Content | Live | Observability & tracing |

### 🏋️Preparation (presenter quick-check)

Purpose: a short, actionable checklist to get a presenter ready for a live session. The repo contains more detailed setup steps in `./docs/01.Installation.md` — use the checklist below as the final pre-session verification.

Pre-session checklist (30–60 minutes before)

- [ ] Clone the repository (or pull latest if already cloned)
- [ ] Install prerequisites — follow `session-delivery-resources/docs/Prerequisites.md`
- [ ] Deploy required cloud resources (see `session-delivery-resources/docs/02.NeededCloudResources.md`) or confirm they already exist
- [ ] Follow the instructions in `session-delivery-resources/docs/03.HowToRunDemoLocally.md` to run the demo locally and verify health endpoints

Fallback & recording guidance

- If a live demo fails (service doesn't start, index not ready, or external resource is inaccessible) — play the recorded demo clip for that segment and mark the runbook with the issue.
- For fragile demos (search/indexing, external APIs), prefer the recorded fallback during high-risk sessions.

### 🖥️Demos

All demos reference the userguide files in the `session-delivery-resources/Demo/` folder. For each demo, use the referenced minimal userguide for talking points. If a demo is fragile or long-running, prefer a recorded segment.

| Demo | Link | Type | Mode | Short description |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 01 | [AI Foundry Agents](./Demo/01/01_demo_minimal.md) | Internal | Live (recorded fallback) | Agent/playground management; create/configure agents; demonstrate inventory agent returning structured JSON. |
| 02 | [Aspire — Single Agent](./Demo/02/02_demo_minimal.md) | Internal | Recorded (recommended) | Single-agent flow using Aspire orchestration: semantic search and image analysis workflow. |
| 03 | [Multi-Agent Orchestration](./Demo/03/03_demo_minimal.md) | Internal | Live (recorded fallback) | Orchestration patterns (sequential, concurrent, handoff); triggers across inventory, matchmaking, location, navigation services. |
| 04 | [Azure Monitor & AI Foundry Diagnostics](./Demo/04/04_demo_minimal.md) | Internal | Recorded | Use Azure Monitor and AI Foundry diagnostics to locate and investigate model/service issues. |
